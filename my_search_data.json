Customer Reviews Based on 309 reviews Write a review 92% (283) 6% (19) 1% (4) 1% (3) 0% (0) S Seema (Guwahati, IN) Pretty product that works perfectly! R Rabeen (Chennai, IN) Perfect bottle The bottle is perfect for daily office use — sleek, functional, and stylish. The premium print design gives an elegant, almost 3D feel when touched. Its narrow opening makes it convenient to drink from, and it retains hot water for long hours without any issues. I also received a complimentary bag tag, which was a nice bonus. Custom name engraving requires an extra charge, but overall, the product exceeded expectations. My wife absolutely loves it. P PRATIKSHA WARARKAR (Pune, IN) Bottle review I'm really happy with the purchase,the quality is excellent and leak proof and keeps my drink at right Temp. A Abhinash Topno (Pune, IN) Good I gifted my friend , and she really liked it S Srobona (Kolkata, IN) Nice and Warm The product I received was well-finished. The bottle does keep the drinks warm though I am not sure if it does it for the promised 12+ hours as I have not been able to test it for so long. Other than that, the bottle is handy and light too and the customisation adds a personal touch, even though I think it is on the costlier side for charging 200 rupees just for the engraving. But other than that, it is a nice purchase and I quite like it. 1 2 3 Refresh Your Style with Peach Quench Water Bottles Introducing the Peach Quench water bottle collection, where style meets functionality.

Specially designed diaries, laptop and iPad cases, travel pouches and wallets, AirPods covers, and sling bags are hard to come by.
