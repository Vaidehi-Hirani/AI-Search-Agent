R Rabeen (Chennai, IN) Perfect bottle The bottle is perfect for daily office use — sleek, functional, and stylish. The premium print design gives an elegant, almost 3D feel when touched. Its narrow opening makes it convenient to drink from, and it retains hot water for long hours without any issues. I also received a complimentary bag tag, which was a nice bonus. Custom name engraving requires an extra charge, but overall, the product exceeded expectations. My wife absolutely loves it. P PRATIKSHA WARARKAR (Pune, IN) Bottle review I'm really happy with the purchase,the quality is excellent and leak proof and keeps my drink at right Temp. A Abhinash Topno (Pune, IN) Good I gifted my friend , and she really liked it S Srobona (Kolkata, IN) Nice and Warm The product I received was well-finished. The bottle does keep the drinks warm though I am not sure if it does it for the promised 12+ hours as I have not been able to test it for so long. Other than that, the bottle is handy and light too and the customisation adds a personal touch, even though I think it is on the costlier side for charging 200 rupees just for the engraving. But other than that, it is a nice purchase and I quite like it. 1 2 3 Refresh Your Style with Peach Quench Water Bottles Introducing the Peach Quench water bottle collection, where style meets functionality.

Watch our Interview with Radiocity A FEW WORDS FROM AAYUSH AND AANCHAL - So, it all started with our passion for travel gear, which led us to sell our first ever product - passport covers, which turned out to be a huge hit. After establishing a strong customer base, we discovered that they also desire unique and \"out-of-the-box\" products, which is how we developed our second set of unique products, which are delivered to your door with a grin. Specially designed diaries, laptop and iPad cases, travel pouches and wallets, AirPods covers, and sling bags are hard to come by. We've always sought to sell things that are not just attractive but also high-quality and well-designed. You can not only choose from a large choice of products with us, but you can also customize any of them with your name and your favorite charm. TMC's customization service is unrivaled in the industry, and we can ensure you that you will be the proud owner of something that will outperform the competition! “We love beautiful things, and we love personalization, in short, We like to create gifts that we would love to keep for ourselves!” We listen to our consumers to understand their needs and build products that fit their needs without losing our unique style.

Munmun Mukherjee Personalised Glass Phone Cover - Cursive Style 09/07/2020 Superb work We loved the finishing of the passport covers Muzammil Husain Saiyed Mr & Mrs Personalised Couple Passport Covers 09/06/2020 Amazing!!!! Having a diary with my own name and a small picture if a life long dream of mine is an amazing feeling. The journal as such apart from its looks , is very good . The paper quality is very nice and it was delivered in top notch condition. The clips holding the paper together is very convenient and also lets us add more paper if necessary. Totally worth the price G Sunitha Personalised Button Diary - Grey 09/06/2020 Excellent Combo Gift!! Combining a Passport Cover, Cover for Glares and a luggage tag is really a brilliant idea. A perfect gift for anyone who is planning to travel. I would definitely recommend creating more such combos to add variations for customers to choose from. Packaging is also excellent. Pricing of these combos can be made more reasonable. Highly recommend this product. Saurabh Fegade Wanderlust Hamper - Personalised Gift Box 09/05/2020 Loved my purchase! The Grey Leather is faux and yet is very nice to look at and feel.  The butterfly charm i chose is also well made and pretty.  The personalised name tag in pink looks feminine and professional.

Customer Reviews Based on 309 reviews Write a review 92% (283) 6% (19) 1% (4) 1% (3) 0% (0) S Seema (Guwahati, IN) Pretty product that works perfectly! R Rabeen (Chennai, IN) Perfect bottle The bottle is perfect for daily office use — sleek, functional, and stylish. The premium print design gives an elegant, almost 3D feel when touched. Its narrow opening makes it convenient to drink from, and it retains hot water for long hours without any issues. I also received a complimentary bag tag, which was a nice bonus. Custom name engraving requires an extra charge, but overall, the product exceeded expectations. My wife absolutely loves it. P PRATIKSHA WARARKAR (Pune, IN) Bottle review I'm really happy with the purchase,the quality is excellent and leak proof and keeps my drink at right Temp. A Abhinash Topno (Pune, IN) Good I gifted my friend , and she really liked it S Srobona (Kolkata, IN) Nice and Warm The product I received was well-finished. The bottle does keep the drinks warm though I am not sure if it does it for the promised 12+ hours as I have not been able to test it for so long. Other than that, the bottle is handy and light too and the customisation adds a personal touch, even though I think it is on the costlier side for charging 200 rupees just for the engraving. But other than that, it is a nice purchase and I quite like it. 1 2 3 Refresh Your Style with Peach Quench Water Bottles Introducing the Peach Quench water bottle collection, where style meets functionality.
